Hi Team Good morning

this is code for banking system,which has feature like adding amount , 
checking balance, withdrawing amount,and transferring amount to the
 other account 
so for that here i have done T1 testing, and the scenarios are like
1)Adding_Funds_Update_Balance()
2)Adding_Negative_Funds_Throws()
3)Withdrawing_Funds_Updates_Balance()
4)Withdrawing_Negative_Funds_Throws()
5)Withdrawing_More_Than_Balance_Throws()
6)Transferring_Funds_Updates_Both_Account()
7)Transferring_To_Non_Existing_Account_Throws()

first of all i have stored bank account balance 1000
and created a variable named account
 in the first scenario i have added 500 then the total amount is 1500 
to validate the here i have used assert.
